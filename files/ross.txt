Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch.
We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. There it is.
If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves.
Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy.
You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. The least little bit can do so much.

Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world.
I like to beat the brush. This is unplanned it really just happens.
Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds.

With practice comes confidence. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. You can get away with a lot.
Let's build some happy little clouds up here. We'll make some happy little bushes here.

If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path.
In this world, everything can be happy. If you hypnotize it, it will go away.
Let your heart be your guide.

Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life.
Let the paint work. All you have to learn here is how to have fun.

I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. No worries. No cares.
